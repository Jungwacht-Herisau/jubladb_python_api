# JublaDB Python API
A package with generated code to access a [Jubla DB](https://db.jubla.ch) API with Python code.

## Mustache templates
A few templates needed modifications to make it work. The original files can be found in the [OpenAPI-Generator GitHub Repo](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/tree/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/main/resources/python).
Updates from there should be merged into the templates here from time to time. There's no automated way for that yet.
